   source dev-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: dev-env\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

6. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   python strava_assistant.py --help  # Basic functionality test
   ```

7. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request** with a clear description of your changes

## üéØ Specific Contribution Ideas

### Caption Templates
Add new templates in `caption_generator.py`:
```python
'new_run_type': [
    "Template with {placeholders} for dynamic content",
    "Another variation with {different} context",
]
```

### Location Intelligence
Enhance location processing in `photo_processor.py`:
- Add support for local landmarks
- Improve trail name recognition
- Add weather context integration

### Photo Analysis
Extend photo analysis capabilities:
- Computer vision for scenery detection
- Weather condition recognition
- Time of day estimation from lighting

## üìã Code Standards

### Python Code Style
- Use **Black** for formatting: `black .`
- Use **isort** for imports: `isort .`
- Follow **PEP 8** conventions
- Add **type hints** where possible
- Include **docstrings** for functions and classes

### Commit Messages
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be descriptive: "Add morning run caption templates" 
- Reference issues: "Fix #123: Handle empty GPX files"

### Testing
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test with real GPX files and photos when possible

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **System information** (OS, Python version)
- **Sample files** if relevant (anonymized GPX/photos)
- **Error messages** and stack traces

## üí° Feature Requests

For feature requests, please describe:
- **Use case** - what problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution** - how should it work?
- **Alternative solutions** - what else did you consider?
- **Implementation ideas** - technical approach if you have one

## üöÄ Development Tips

### Testing with Real Data
- Use your own GPX files and photos for testing
- Anonymize any sensitive location data before sharing
- Test with various GPS devices and photo sources

### Local Development Workflow
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run with test data
python strava_assistant.py process test_photos/ test_route.gpx

# Test caption generation
python caption_generator.py test_data.json

# Monitor file changes during development
python strava_assistant.py watch --photos ~/test_photos --gpx ~/test_gpx
```

### MCP Server Development
```bash
cd strava-mcp
npm run build
npm run dev  # For development with hot reload
```

## üìñ Documentation

### README Updates
- Keep examples current with code changes
- Add new features to the feature list
- Update installation instructions if needed

### Code Documentation
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update type hints for better IDE support
- Include usage examples in docstrings

## ü§ñ AI and Automation Guidelines

### Caption Generation
- Templates should feel natural and conversational
- Include context-specific variations
- Test with different running scenarios
- Consider cultural and regional differences

### Photo Processing
- Handle various photo formats and qualities
- Consider privacy implications of location data
- Optimize for speed with large photo collections
- Gracefully handle missing or corrupt EXIF data
